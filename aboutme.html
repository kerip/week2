<p>I am a 30 year old mom, born in Memphis, Tennessee and moved to Murfreesboro when I began high school in 2003. I raise two hilarious children. We treat every day like a party. I work hard to give my kids the childhood that I did not necessarily have and with that, comes many hats! I own a massage spa that has just recently expanded to include a Wellness Store and Aesthetics. I am a certified Personal Trainer, taking the test to become a certified Health Coach soon and a college Biology student. I have a master plan that includes all of these necessary fields of study and certificates! I want to offer holistic healthcare to people at an affordable price. Many people consider the idea of "self care" a luxury and it is absolutely something that every human on this planet deserves. By adding Web Development to my list of expertise, I will be able to run and expand my businesses via internet without having to outsource and settle for the parameters of business applications, website builders and other peoples' style. Also, it would be great to sit on my butt and work from home one day. So, cheers!</p>
